# Python Generative Image Captioning with Conditioned LSTM Recurrent Neural Network

## Overview
This project implements a LSTM language generator model for generating image captions. The model is conditioned on encoded image inputs from a pre-trained CNN Inception V3 image encoder.

## Key Features
- Developed LSTM model using Numpy, Matplotlib, & Keras-Tensorflow
- Trained LSTM model on word2vec image captions on cloud GPU
- Preprocessed images using pre-trained CNN Inception V3 image encoder
- Conditioned LSTM generator with encoded image inputs
- Decoded & validated LSTM language model image inputs using greedy & beam search for generative captioning
